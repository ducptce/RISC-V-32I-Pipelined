# RISC-V-32I-Pipelined
This project features a RISC-V 32I processor designed with a simple pipeline in SystemVerilog, covering Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Write-back stages. A testbench ensures robust verification with simulated memory and register models. Ideal for learning RISC-V architecture and pipeline design. Contributions are welcome!
